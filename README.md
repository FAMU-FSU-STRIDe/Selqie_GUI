# Selqie GUI

## Introduction
This graphical user interface is a project I am working on as a research assistant in CISCOR Research Laboratory at FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. This GUI is designed for SELQIE (Seafloor Environment Quadruped Intelligent Explorer), which is an ongoing project under the Office of Naval Research. This GUI is being built to transfer control from the command line in an effort to cut down setup time. This GUI is also an effort to allow more people to be able to use SELQIE without having to have any linux knowledge. 

## Parts
So far in this project, I have utilized tkinter, PIL, cv2, ROS2 Humble, and python subprocess.
